# Use case

Paxcounter is a proof-of-concept device for metering passenger flows in realtime. It counts how many mobile devices are around. This gives an estimation how many people are around. Paxcounter detects Wifi and Bluetooth signals in the air, focusing on mobile devices by filtering vendor OUIs in the MAC adress.

Intention of this project is to do this without intrusion in privacy: You don't need to track people owned devices, if you just want to count them. Therefore, Paxcounter does not persistenly store MAC adresses and does no kind of fingerprinting the scanned devices.

Data is transferred to a server via a LoRaWAN network, and/or a wired SPI slave interface.

You can build this project battery powered and reach a full day uptime with a single 18650 Li-Ion cell.

This can all be done with a single small and cheap ESP32 board for less than $20.

Some <b>3D printable cases</b> can be found (and, if wanted so, ordered) on Thingiverse, see

<b>Power consumption</b> was metered at around 450 - 1000mW, depending on board and user settings in paxcounter.conf.
By default bluetooth sniffing is disabled (line *#define BLECOUNTER* in paxcounter.conf is commented out). Enabling bluetooth costs 30% more power + 30% flash storage for the software stack. Proof of concept showed that for passenger flow metering wifi sniffing shows better results than bluetooth sniffing. If you enable bluetooth be aware that this goes on expense of wifi sniffing results, because then wifi and bt stack must share the 2,4 GHz RF ressources of ESP32. If you need to sniff wifi and bt in parallel and need best possible results, use two boards - one for wifi only and one for bt only - and add counted results.

# Preparing

Before compiling the code,

- **edit src/paxcounter.conf** and tailor settings in this file according to your needs and use case. Please take care of the duty cycle regulations of the LoRaWAN network you're going to use.

- **edit src/lmic_config.h** and tailor settings in this file according to your country and device hardware. Please take care of national regulations when selecting the frequency band for LoRaWAN.

- **create file loraconf.h in your local /src directory** using the template [loraconf.sample.h](https://github.com/cyberman54/ESP32-Paxcounter/blob/master/src/loraconf.sample.h) and populate it with your personal APPEUI und APPKEY for the LoRaWAN network. If you're using popular <A HREF="https://thethingsnetwork.org">TheThingsNetwork</A> you can copy&paste the keys from TTN console or output of ttnctl.

- **create file ota.conf in your local /src directory** using the template [ota.sample.conf](https://github.com/cyberman54/ESP32-Paxcounter/blob/master/src/ota.sample.conf) and enter your WIFI network&key. These settings are used for downloading updates. If you want to push own OTA updates you need a <A HREF="https://bintray.com/JFrog">Bintray account</A>. Enter your Bintray user account data in ota.conf. If you don't need wireless firmware updates just rename ota.sample.conf to ota.conf.

To join the network only method OTAA is supported, not ABP. The DEVEUI for OTAA will be derived from the device's MAC adress during device startup and is shown as well on the device's display (if it has one) as on the serial console for copying it to your LoRaWAN network server settings.

If your device has a fixed DEVEUI enter this in your local loraconf.h file. During compile time this DEVEUI will be grabbed from loraconf.h and inserted in the code.

If your device has silicon **Unique ID** which is stored in serial EEPROM Microchip 24AA02E64 you don't need to change anything. The Unique ID will be read during startup and DEVEUI will be generated from it, overriding settings in loraconf.h.

If your device has a **real time clock** date/time of rtc will be updated bei either LoRaWAN network or GPS time (if present).

# Building

Use <A HREF="https://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</A> with your preferred IDE for development and building this code. Make sure you have latest PlatformIO version.

# Uploading

- **Initially, using USB/UART cable:**
To upload the code via cable to your ESP32 board this needs to be switched from run to bootloader mode. Boards with USB bridge like Heltec and TTGO usually have an onboard logic which allows soft switching by the upload tool. In PlatformIO this happenes automatically.<p>
The LoPy/LoPy4/FiPy board needs to be set manually. See these 
<A HREF="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/labs/story/program-your-lopy-from-the-arduino-ide-using-lmic">instructions</A> how to do it. Don't forget to press on board reset button after switching between run and bootloader mode.<p>
The original Pycom firmware is not needed, so there is no need to update it before flashing Paxcounter. Just flash the compiled paxcounter binary (.elf file) on your LoPy/LoPy4/FiPy. If you later want to go back to the Pycom firmware, download the firmware from Pycom and flash it over.<p>
The TTGO T3_V1.6 can be switched into bootloader mode by connecting IO2 with GND as shown in this picture:<p>
<img src="img/TTGO_T3_V1.6_flash.jpg" width="400px">
	
- **During runtime, using FOTA via WIFI:**
After the ESP32 board is initially flashed and has joined a LoRaWAN network, the firmware can update itself by FOTA. This process is kicked off by sending a remote control command (see below) via LoRaWAN to the board. The board then tries to connect via WIFI to a cloud service (JFrog Bintray), checks for update, and if available downloads the binary and reboots with it. If something goes wrong during this process, the board reboots back to the current version. Prerequisites for FOTA are: 1. You own a Bintray repository, 2. you pushed the update binary to the Bintray repository, 3. internet access via encrypted (WPA2) WIFI is present at the board's site, 4. WIFI credentials were set in ota.conf and initially flashed to the board. Step 2 runs automated, just enter the credentials in ota.conf and set `upload_protocol = custom` in platformio.ini. Then press build and lean back watching platformio doing build and upload.

# Legal note

**Depending on your country's laws it may be illegal to sniff wireless networks for MAC addresses. Please check and respect your country's laws before using this code!**

(e.g. US citizens may want to check [Section 18 U.S. Code ยง 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511) and [discussion](https://github.com/schollz/howmanypeoplearearound/issues/4) on this)

(e.g. UK citizens may want to check [Data Protection Act 1998](https://ico.org.uk/media/1560691/wi-fi-location-analytics-guidance.pdf) and [GDPR 2018](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/))

(e.g. Citizens in the the Netherlands may want to read [this article](https://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/download/PrivacyInformatie_2016_6.pdf) and [this article](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/nieuws/europese-privacytoezichthouders-publiceren-opinie-eprivacyverordening)) 

Note: If you use this software you do this at your own risk. That means that you alone - not the authors of this software - are responsible for the legal compliance of an application using this or build from this software and/or usage of a device created using this software. You should take special care and get prior legal advice if you plan metering passengers in public areas and/or publish data drawn from doing so.

# Privacy disclosure

Paxcounter generates identifiers for sniffed MAC adresses and collects them temporary in the device's RAM for a configurable scan cycle time (default 60 seconds). After each scan cycle the collected identifiers are cleared. Identifiers are generated by salting and hashing MAC adresses. The random salt value changes after each scan cycle. Identifiers and MAC adresses are never transferred to the LoRaWAN network. No persistent storing of MAC adresses, identifiers or timestamps and no other kind of analytics than counting are implemented in this code. Wireless networks are not touched by this code, but MAC adresses from wireless devices as well within as not within wireless networks, regardless if encrypted or unencrypted, are sniffed and processed by this code. If the bluetooth option in the code is enabled, bluetooth MACs are scanned and processed by the included BLE stack, then hashed and counted by this code.

# LED blink pattern

**Mono color LED:**

- Single Flash (50ms): seen a new Wifi or BLE device
- Quick blink (20ms on each 1/5 second): joining LoRaWAN network in progress or pending
- Small blink (10ms on each 1/2 second): LoRaWAN data transmit in progress or pending
- Long blink (200ms on each 2 seconds): LoRaWAN stack error
- Single long flash (2sec): Known beacon detected

**RGB LED:**

- Green each blink: seen a new Wifi device
- Magenta each blink: seen a new BLE device
- Yellow quick blink: joining LoRaWAN network in progress or pending
- Blue blink: LoRaWAN data transmit in progress or pending
- Red long blink: LoRaWAN stack error
- White long blink: Known Beacon detected

# Clock controller

Paxcounter can be used to sync a clock which has DCF77 or IF482 time telegram input with an external time source. Use case of this function is to have paxcounter hardware integrated in clocks, and use it for both counting of pax and controlling the clock. Supported external time sources are GPS time, LORAWAN network time (v1.1) and on board RTC time. Precision of the synthetic DCF77 signal depends on precision of on board available time base. Supported are both external time base (e.g. timepulse pin of GPS chip or oscillator output of RTC chip) and internal ESP32 hardware timer. Selection of time base and clock frequency is done by #defines in the board's hal file, see example in [**generic.h**](src/hal/generic.h).

# Payload format

You can select different payload formats in [paxcounter.conf](src/paxcounter.conf#L12):

- ***Plain*** uses big endian format and generates json fields, e.g. useful for TTN console

- ***Packed*** uses little endian format and generates json fields

- [***CayenneLPP***](https://mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload-reference-implementation) generates MyDevices Cayenne readable fields

If you're using [TheThingsNetwork](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) (TTN) you may want to use a payload converter. Go to TTN Console - Application - Payload Formats and paste the code example below in tabs Decoder and Converter. This way your MQTT application can parse the fields `pax`, `ble` and `wifi`.

To add your device to myDevices Cayenne platform select "Cayenne-LPP" from Lora device list and use the CayenneLPP payload encoder. 

To track a paxcounter device with on board GPS and at the same time contribute to TTN coverage mapping, you simply activate the [TTNmapper integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/ttnmapper/) in TTN Console. The formats *plain* and *packed* generate the fields `latitude`, `longitude` and `hdop` required by ttnmapper.

Hereafter described is the default *plain* format, which uses MSB bit numbering. Under /TTN in this repository you find some ready-to-go decoders which you may copy to your TTN console:

[**plain_decoder.js**](src/TTN/plain_decoder.js) | 
[**plain_converter.js**](src/TTN/plain_converter.js) |
[**packed_decoder.js**](src/TTN/packed_decoder.js) |
