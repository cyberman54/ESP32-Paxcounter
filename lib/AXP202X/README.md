AXP202X_Library
=====================================
- axp192 partial support, the function is not fully tested, please refer to the manual
- The `setPowerOutPut` function has forced DCDC3 to be turned on and cannot be controlled because T-Watch uses DCDC3 as the esp32 to power the main chip. If it is turned off, the hardware cannot be programmed.
